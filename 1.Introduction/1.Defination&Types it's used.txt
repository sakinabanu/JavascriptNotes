JavaScript :

JavaScript is a popular programming language which is in demand now-a-days.

At early days JavaScript was used mainly for making webpages & making it interactive such as form validation, animation, etc. But now JavaScript is used in many other areas such as server-side development, mobile app development and many more. Because of its wide range of applications, you can run JavaScript in several ways:
	i.    Using console tab of web browsers
	ii.   Using Node.js
	iii.  By creating web pages

1. Using Console Tab of Web Browsers:

All the popular web browsers have built-in JavaScript engines. Hence, you can run JavaScript on a browser. To run JavaScript on a browser,

Step are:
Open a browser (like Google Chrome).
Open the developer tools by right clicking on an empty area and select Inspect. 
Inspect Browser
On the developer tools, go to the console tab. Then, write JavaScript code and press enter to run the code.
few examples for console tabs are:
3+4
>7
5*2
>10

2. Using Node.js:

Node is a back-end run-time environment for executing JavaScript code. To run JS using Node.js.

Steps are:
Install the latest version of Node.js.
Install an IDE/Text Editor like Visual Studio Code. 
In VS code, create a file > write JS code > save it with file.js extension.
Code in IDE
>3+4
Open up the terminal/command prompt > navigate to the file location > type node file.js > Do enter.
Execute JS code in node
7
You will get output on the terminal.

Note: It is also possible to run JavaScript on the terminal/command prompt directly. For that, simply type node and press enter. Then you can start writing JS code.
Eg:
C:\Users\Dell>node
Welcome to Node.js v18.17.0.
Type ".help" for more information.

3. By Creating Web Pages:

JavaScript was initially created to make web pages interactive, that's why JavaScript and HTML go hand in hand. To run JS from a webpage, follow these steps:

Open VS Code > Go to File > New File > Save it with .html extension. For example, main.html.
Copy this doctype and save it in the file.

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Programiz</title>
</head>
<body>
<script src=""></script>
</body>
</html>

Similarly create a JS file, write the following JS code and save it with .js extension like main.js.

console.log('hello world');

JS code in a main.js

From inside the HTML file, we need to link the main.js file to use it. You can achieve that by adding the following code in main.html.

<script scr="main.js"></script>

HTML code in a file

Open the main.html file using a browser.

To check if our JS code ran or not, Right click on the web page > Inspect > Choose console tab.
