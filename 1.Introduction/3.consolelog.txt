JAVASCRIPT CONSOLE.LOG():

All browsers have a web console for debugging. The console.log() method is used to write messages to these consoles. 
For example,
let sum = 44;
console.log(sum);   // 44
When you run the above code, 44 is printed on the console.

SYNTAX:

console.log(message);
Here, the message refers to either a variable or a value.

Note: We will be using the console.log() method to display the output in our upcoming lessons.

Example 1: Print a Sentence
	console.log("I love JS");

Output:
	I love JS

Example 2: Print Values Stored in Variables
	const greet = 'Hello';
	const name = 'Jack';
	console.log(greet + ' ' + name);
Output:
	Hello Jack
As you can see from these examples, console.log() makes it easier to see the value inside a variable. That's why it's commonly used for testing/debugging code.
